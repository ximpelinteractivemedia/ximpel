// MediaPlayer()
// The media player is the component that plays a MediaModel. When you define a media item in the playlist, for instance
// a <video> or an <audio> media item, then the parser will convert this to a MediaModel which contains all the information
// about that media item such as: the duration, the overlays to be shown, the custom attributes and elements that were added
// between the media tags (between <video> and </video>), the variable modifers, etc.
// The MediaPlayer is responsible for:
// - starting the media item (ie. doing mediaItem.play() )
// - Showing/hiding overlays at the appropriate times.
// - Showing/hiding questions at the apropriate times.
